SUBER is a TAXI company whose motto is "why ride UBER if you can ride SUBER." Knowing that you are a boilermaker taking CS348, SUBER wants you to draw an ERD for its new driver-customer information system. The ER Diagram covers following information.
A driver is identified by license number and state. Driver information includes name and age. A customer is identified by customer id and has name and credit card number. A car is identified by VIN number and has a make, model, year and current mileage.
A driver may either own or rent a car. If a driver is an owner, the system records the starting mileage when the driver started using their car in SUBER. If the driver is renting their car from SUBER, the system records the starting and ending dates of the rent contract. The system keeps track of the date and amount of the monthly rent installments the drive has made. We assume that the driver has only one car in the SUBER system (owned or rented).
A customer may post a review about a certain trip involving a certain car and a certain driver. The review contains and a description, date-time, and a number of stars.
A specific car make-model-year may have recalls. The SUBER system must store the date and description of each recall.
