Consider the following scenario for a travel website, such as Expedia and Priceline. The website collects flight information from different airlines to provide different options to travelers.

There are two types of trips: One-way and round-trip. Each trip has a unique number, class (economy, business, and first), and price. Each one-way and round trip has an origin and a destination. The one-way trip has a departure date-time, arrival date-time, and the duration of the trip. A two-way trip has these attributes for both flights (first flight from the origin to the destination and the second flight from the destination to the origin).
A trip is sold by an airline, which has a name and rating. However, a single flight (e.g., the one from the destination to the origin) can be operated by a different airline.
A trip has one or more allowed bag types (backpack, carry-on, and checked) where each bag type has a maximum weight. A trip has a specific price for each allowed bag type and a maximum number of bags.
