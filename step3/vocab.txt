Consider the following scenario for a travel website, such as Expedia and Priceline. The website collects flight information from different airlines to provide different options to travelers.
There are two types of trips: One-way and round-trip. Each trip has a unique number, class (economy, business, and first), and price. Each one-way and round trip has an origin and a destination. The one-way trip has a departure date-time, arrival date-time, and the duration of the trip. A two-way trip has these attributes for both flights (first flight from the origin to the destination and the second flight from the destination to the origin).
A trip is sold by an airline, which has a name and rating. However, a single flight (e.g., the one from the destination to the origin) can be operated by a different airline.
A trip has one or more allowed bag types (backpack, carry-on, and checked) where each bag type has a maximum weight. A trip has a specific price for each allowed bag type and a maximum number of bags.

There are TV series, which have names, networks and production companies, and are identified by the name and network.
A TV series has one or more seasons, which are identified by the number of the season. A season also has the number of episodes and the year the season starts. No season can exist without a corresponding series.
A season has one or more episodes, identified by episode number, which is unique within the season. Each episode also has a title and a length. No episode can exist without a corresponding season.
An actor is identified by name and birth date, and also has a nationality.
A writer is also identified by name and birth date, and has a talent agency that represents him or her.
An actor can appear as a “regular” on a TV series or a guest star on an episode.
An episode has one or more writers. A writer can write one or more
episodes.

SUBER is a TAXI company whose motto is "why ride UBER if you can ride SUBER." Knowing that you are a boilermaker taking CS348, SUBER wants you to draw an ERD for its new driver-customer information system. The ER Diagram covers following information.
A driver is identified by license number and state. Driver information includes name and age. A customer is identified by customer id and has name and credit card number. A car is identified by VIN number and has a make, model, year and current mileage.
A driver may either own or rent a car. If a driver is an owner, the system records the starting mileage when the driver started using their car in SUBER. If the driver is renting their car from SUBER, the system records the starting and ending dates of the rent contract. The system keeps track of the date and amount of the monthly rent installments the drive has made. We assume that the driver has only one car in the SUBER system (owned or rented).
A customer may post a review about a certain trip involving a certain car and a certain driver. The review contains and a description, date-time, and a number of stars.
A specific car make-model-year may have recalls. The SUBER system must store the date and description of each recall.
